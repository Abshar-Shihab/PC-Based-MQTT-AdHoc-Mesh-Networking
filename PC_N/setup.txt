First open cmd as administrator, go to the mosquitto directory
cd C:\Program Files\mosquitto

Then start it by
net start mosquitto

if u want to check the connectivity 
netstat -a   ---> ensure that 1883 port is listening


First of all config the file to connect the different pcs
so fisrt stop if the mosquitto runs using this command
net stop mosquitto

then, open the mosquitto.conf file in mosquitto diretory and go to the LISTENERS part
uncommand the last line of listern and include this
listener 1883 0.0.0.0


after that go to the SECURITY topic, #allow_anonymous false -----> we have to change it below
allow_anonymous true

and save it in the config and again run the mosquitto


Before all these things, you have to open a port to listen in windows firewall
so that, Open the Run (wind+R) and type 
wf.msc

and go to the inbound, select port, give the port number 1883, and give the name
do the same thing for outbound also.


open another terminal for subcriber and enter this
mosquitto_sub -t test_sensor_data -h localhost		------> change locahost with ipaddr


another PC, start the mosquitto and run this command for publisher
mosquitto_pub -t test_sensor_data -h 172.16.2.106 -m "temp:100"


now both pcs are connected
