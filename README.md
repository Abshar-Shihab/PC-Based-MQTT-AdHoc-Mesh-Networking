# PC-Based MQTT AdHoc Mesh Networking

## Project Overview

We are a team of four members working on developing a PC-based MQTT AdHoc mesh networking protocol. Our primary goal is to establish a robust messaging system using MQTT and Mosquitto. This project serves as a precursor to implementing the protocol on IoT devices, ensuring that we thoroughly understand the underlying mechanisms and requirements.

## Project Goals

- **Understanding Mesh Networking**: Before transitioning to IoT devices, we aim to grasp the essentials of mesh networking and the MQTT protocol.
- **Testing and Validation**: By implementing and testing the protocol on PCs, we can validate our approach and troubleshoot any issues in a controlled environment.
- **Scalability**: Our setup will provide insights into the scalability of the network and its efficiency in message routing.

## Why MQTT Mesh Network?

### Benefits of MQTT

- **Lightweight Protocol**: MQTT is designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. Its lightweight nature makes it ideal for IoT applications.
- **Publish/Subscribe Model**: This model allows for efficient message distribution and decouples the producers and consumers of information.
- **Scalability**: MQTT can easily scale from small home networks to large industrial applications.

### Benefits of Mesh Networking

- **Redundancy**: Mesh networks provide multiple paths for data to travel, ensuring reliability and redundancy.
- **Self-Healing**: In case of node failures, mesh networks can automatically reconfigure to maintain communication.
- **Scalability**: Adding more nodes to a mesh network is straightforward and doesn't require significant changes to the existing infrastructure.

## Why AdHoc Routing Protocol?

### Advantages of AdHoc Routing

- **Dynamic Topology**: AdHoc routing protocols can handle frequent changes in network topology, which is common in IoT environments.
- **On-Demand Routing**: Routes are established on an as-needed basis, reducing the overhead of maintaining unused routes.
- **Flexibility**: AdHoc protocols are well-suited for scenarios where network infrastructure is unavailable or impractical.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

1. **MQTT Broker (Mosquitto)**: We use Mosquitto as our MQTT broker to facilitate message routing between nodes.
2. **PC Nodes**: Each PC in the network acts as a node, capable of sending and receiving messages.
3. **Routing Protocol**: We implement a custom AdHoc routing protocol to determine the best path for message delivery.

### Message Sending Process

1. **Connection Establishment**: Each node establishes a connection with the MQTT broker.
2. **Topic Subscription**: Nodes subscribe to relevant topics for message routing.
3. **Message Publishing**: Messages are published to the broker, which forwards them to the appropriate nodes based on the routing protocol.

### Testing and Validation

- **Simulation**: We simulate various network scenarios to test the resilience and efficiency of our protocol.
- **Debugging Tools**: We use tools to view and debug routing tables and monitor message flow between nodes.

## Future Work

- **Transition to IoT Devices**: After validating the protocol on PCs, we plan to implement it on IoT devices.
- **Performance Optimization**: We will optimize the protocol for better performance and lower latency.
- **Security Enhancements**: Adding security features to ensure secure communication between nodes.

## Conclusion

Our PC-Based MQTT AdHoc Mesh Networking project is a significant step towards creating a reliable and scalable messaging system for IoT applications. By thoroughly understanding and validating the protocol on PCs, we ensure a smoother transition to IoT devices in the future.
